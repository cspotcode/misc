Various scripts and tools that might be worth sharing.

The Scripts
---

### `autohotkey/all-open-windows.ahk` ###

AutoHotKey script that periodically dumps a list of all open windows into a log file.
Useful if your computer crashes or you have to reboot to install software updates, and
you want to remember everything that you had open.

### `autohotkey/ctrlL/ctrlL.ahk` ###

Adds Ctrl+L and Ctrl+K shortcuts in Windows Explorer, just like in most web browsers.

* Ctrl+L: Focus the path bar ("address bar") allowing you to start typing a file or folder path.
* Ctrl+K: Focus the search box.

Also allows forcing any window to stay on top of other windows.

To enable/disable "always-on-top" behavior for a window:

* Right-click ctrlL's tray icon
* Click "Toggle Always-on-top"
* Click on a window
